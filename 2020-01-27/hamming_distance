// INSTRUCTIONS: Hamming distance is the number of characters that differ between two strings.

// To illustrate:

// String1: "abcbba"
// String2: "abcbda"

// Hamming Distance: 1 - "b" vs. "d" is the only difference.

// Create a function that computes the hamming distance between two strings.

function hammingDistance(str1, str2) {
	const arr1 = str1.split('');
  const arr2 = str2.split('');
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) {
      counter++;
    } else continue;
  }
  return counter;
