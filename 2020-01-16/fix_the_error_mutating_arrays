// INSTRUCTIONS: Suppose I want to define a function that removes the last element of an array each time I call it, but does not mutate the original array. Fix the code so that the results are no longer mutating the array.

function minusOne(arr) {
	const tempArr = arr.slice(0, -1);
  return tempArr;
}
