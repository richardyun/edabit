// INSTRUCTIONS: A leap year has one day added to February for being synchronized with the seasonal year. A leap year appears with a regular frequency, which is determined by the rule below:

// -A year must either be divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 and not 100.

// Given a year you must implement a function that returns true if it's a leap year, or false if it's not.

function isLeap(year) {
	if (year % 400 === 0 || (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0)) {
    return true;
  } else return false;
}
