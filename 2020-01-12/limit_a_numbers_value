// INSTRUCTIONS: Create a function that takes three number arguments — one number as an input and two additional numbers representing the endpoints of a closed range — and return the number limited to this range.

// -If the number falls within the range, the number should be returned.
// -If the number is less than the lower limit of the range, the lower limit should be returned.
// -If the number is greater than the upper limit of the range, the upper limit should be returned.
