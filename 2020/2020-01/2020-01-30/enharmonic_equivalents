// INSTRUCTIONS: In music, notes can be written out in multiple ways (especially for notes on the black keys). Although these notes are spelled out differently, they still are the same note physically.

//Given a musical note, create a function that returns its enharmonic equivalent. The examples below should make this clear.

function getEquivalent(note) {
	const stringFull = "GABCDEFGA";
  const stringTrim = " ABCDEFG ";
  const noteIndex = stringTrim.indexOf(note[0]);
  const adjustment = {"#": 1, "b": -1}[note[1]];
  const newIndex = noteIndex + adjustment;
  const newSymbol = {"#": "b", "b": "#"}[note[1]];
  return stringFull[newIndex] + newSymbol;
}
