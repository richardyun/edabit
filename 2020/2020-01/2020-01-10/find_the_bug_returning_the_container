// INSTRUCTIONS: The packaging system is running wild and the candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.

// The packaging machine is running the getContainer() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...

			container = "bag";

		case "Beer":
		case "Milk":

			container = "plastic";
