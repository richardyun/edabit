// INSTRUCTIONS: This challenge will help you interpret mathematical relationships both algebraically and geometrically.

// Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the amount of matchsticks in that step. See step 1, 2 and 3 in the image above.

function matchHouses(step) {
	if (step === 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return (step * 6) - (step - 1);
  }
}
