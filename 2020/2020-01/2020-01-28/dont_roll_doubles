// INSTRUCTIONS: John is playing a dice game. The rules are as follows.

// 1. Roll two dice.
// 2. Add the numbers on the dice together.
// 3. Add the total to your overall score.
// 4. Repeat this for three rounds.

// **But if you roll DOUBLES, your score is instantly wiped to 0 and your game ends immediately!**

// Create a function which takes in a matrix as input, and return John's score after his game has ended.
