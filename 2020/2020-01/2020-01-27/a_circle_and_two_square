// INSTRUCTIONS: Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.

// Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the square-areas.

function squareAreasDifference(r) {
	return Math.pow((2 * r), 2) - (2 * Math.pow(r, 2));
}
