// INSTRUCTIONS: In this challenge, you must generate a sequence of consecutive numbers, from a lower bound that will always be equal to 1, up to a variable given higher bound (including the bounds in the sequence).

// Each number of the sequence that can be exactly divided by 4 must be amplified by 10 (see notes below).

// Given a higher bound num, implement a function that returns an array with the sequence of numbers, after that every multiple of 4 has been amplified.

function amplify(num) {
	const arr = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    if (i % 4 === 0) {
      arr.push(i * 10);
    } else {
      arr.push(i)
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
