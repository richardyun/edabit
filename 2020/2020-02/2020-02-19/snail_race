// INSTRUCTIONS: Steve and Maurice have racing snails. They each have 3, a slow (s), medium (m) and fast (f) one. Although Steve's snails are all a bit stronger than Maurice's, Maurice has a trick up his sleeve. His plan is:

// 1. Round 1: [s, f] Sacrifice his slowest snail against Steve's fastest.
// 2. Round 2: [m, s] Use his middle snail against Steve's slowest.
// 3. Round 3: [f, m] Use his fastest snail against Steve's middle.

// Create a function that determines whether Maurice's plan will work by outputting true if Maurice wins 2/3 games.

// The function inputs:

// 1. Array 1: [s, m, f] for Maurice.
// 2. Array 2: [s, m, f] for Steve.
