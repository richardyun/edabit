// INSTRUCTIONS: This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

// Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produce the sample outputs shown.

function mysteryFunc(arr, num) {
  const newArr = arr.map(x => x % num);
  return newArr;
}
