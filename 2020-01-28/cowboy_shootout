// INSTRUCTIONS: Wild Roger is tasked with shooting down 6 bottles with 6 shots as fast as possible. Here are the different types of shots he could make:

// -He could use one pistol to shoot a bottle with a "Bang!" in 0.5 seconds.
// -Or he could use both pistols at once with a "BangBang!" to shoot two bottles in 0.5 seconds.

// Given an array of strings, return the time (in seconds) it took to shoot down all 6 bottles. Make sure to only count Bangs and BangBangs. Anything else doesn't count.

function rogerShots(arr) {
	const newArr = arr.filter(x => x === "Bang!" | x === "BangBang!");
  return newArr.length * 0.5;
}
