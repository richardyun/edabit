// INSTRUCTIONS: Create a function that calculates the profit margin given costPrice and salesPrice. Return the result as a percentage formated string, and rounded to one decimals. To calculate profit margin you subtract the cost from the sales price, then divide by salesprice.

function profitMargin(costPrice, salesPrice) {
	const profit = salesPrice - costPrice;
  const percentProfit = ((profit / salesPrice) * 100).toFixed(1);
  return percentProfit + "%";
}
