// INSTRUCTIONS: A game of table tennis almost always sounds like Ping! followed by Pong! Therefore, you know that Player 2 has won if you hear Pong! as the last sound (since Player 1 didn't return the ball back).

// Given an array of Ping!, create a function that inserts Pong! in between each element. Also:

// -If win equals True, end the list with Pong!.
// -If win equals False, end with Ping! instead.

function pingPong(arr, win) {
	const pong = "Pong!";
  const newArr = [];
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    newArr.push(arr[i]);
    newArr.push(pong);
  }
  if (!win) {
    newArr.pop();
  }
  return newArr;
}
